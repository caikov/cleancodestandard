Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.

Robert C.Martin, aka uncle Bob has teamed up his colleagues to invent 'Clean Code' concept in his book [***Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship***](http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882 "Clean Code"), programming shall be in clean code way, that will instill within you he values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer.

This standard intends to give out a light weight common, describe clearly, easy understand and operate guideline. Making it can be followed by junior clean coder.
